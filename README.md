# Coursera

Computer Vision is one of the most exciting fields in Machine Learning and AI. It has applications in many industries, such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, and much more. 

As part of this course, I will utilize Python, Pillow, and OpenCV for basic image processing and perform image classification and object detection.

This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. Labs will combine Jupyter Labs and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio), a free learning tool for computer vision. CV Studio allows uploading, training, and testing custom image classifier and detection models.  At the end of the course, I will create my own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud.
